Chat Tests for AgentBot
=======================

Overview:
---------
This document describes the various chat commands implemented as tests for the AgentBot.
These commands allow you to trigger different actions in the bot for testing purposes,
including mining, crafting, smelting, farming, tool management, inventory sorting, and chest interaction.
All commands are issued via chat messages (using the "test" prefix) and are intended for debugging or demonstration.

Test Commands:
--------------

1. test mine <blockName> [count]
   - Description: Instructs the bot to mine a specific block type.
   - Usage: 
       • "test mine stone" 
         => Mines 1 block of stone.
       • "test mine iron_ore 3"
         => Mines 3 blocks of iron ore.
   - Note: The bot will equip the best tool for the given block type before mining.

2. test craft <itemName>
   - Description: Commands the bot to craft the specified item if a recipe exists.
   - Usage:
       • "test craft furnace"
         => Attempts to craft a furnace.
       • "test craft chest"
         => Attempts to craft a chest.

3. test smelt <itemName> [quantity]
   - Description: Initiates the smelting process for a given input item (e.g., iron_ore).
   - Usage:
       • "test smelt iron_ore"
         => Attempts to smelt 1 iron ore into an iron ingot.
       • "test smelt iron_ore 4"
         => Attempts to smelt 4 iron ores.
   - Note: This test will ensure a furnace is placed, open its GUI, insert fuel and the input items,
           and then wait briefly before closing the furnace window.

4. test fuel
   - Description: Provides information about fuel management.
   - Usage:
       • "test fuel"
         => The bot will respond that fuel management is handled internally (mainly within the smelting process).

5. test farm <plant|harvest> <cropName>
   - Description: Handles basic farming actions.
   - Usage:
       • "test farm plant wheat_seeds"
         => Commands the bot to plant wheat seeds on farmland (if available).
       • "test farm harvest wheat"
         => Commands the bot to search for and harvest fully grown wheat.

6. test equip <blockName>
   - Description: Instructs the bot to equip the best tool for interacting with a block.
   - Usage:
       • "test equip stone"
         => The bot will attempt to equip an appropriate tool (e.g., a pickaxe) for stone.

7. test safetable
   - Description: Commands the bot to place a crafting table at a safe nearby location.
   - Usage:
       • "test safetable"
         => The bot will search for a valid placement spot and place a crafting table.

8. test usetable
   - Description: Instructs the bot to use (i.e., interact with) a nearby crafting table.
   - Usage:
       • "test usetable"
         => The bot will locate a nearby crafting table and attempt to interact with it.

9. test sort
   - Description: Initiates a simple inventory sorting routine.
   - Usage:
       • "test sort"
         => The bot will reorder its inventory, grouping similar items together using a basic sorting algorithm.

10. test chest <place|store|get> [itemName] [count]
    - Description: Tests chest-related interactions, including placement and item transfers.
    - Subcommands:
         a) test chest place
            - Places a chest from the bot's inventory at a nearby valid location.
         b) test chest store <itemName> [count]
            - Stores up to the specified count of an item from the bot's inventory into an adjacent chest.
              Example: "test chest store iron_ingot 5"
         c) test chest get <itemName> [count]
            - Retrieves up to the specified count of an item from a nearby chest into the bot's inventory.
              Example: "test chest get iron_ingot 3"
    - Note: These commands require that a chest is present (or placed) nearby and that the chest has the relevant items.

Usage Notes:
------------
- Ensure the bot is in a suitable environment (with appropriate blocks, a furnace, farmland, etc.)
  for the corresponding test command to work properly.
- These test commands are primarily for debugging and demonstration purposes.
- Advanced behaviors (like checking for mature crops or handling multiple recipes)
  may require further refinement in a production environment.
