PIANO Architecture: A Brain-Inspired Approach to Humanlike AI

We introduce PIANO (Parallel Input Aggregation via Neural Orchestration), an architecture inspired by the brain. It leverages two key design principles—concurrency and an information bottleneck—to enable AI agents to interact with their environment in real time, much like a pianist orchestrates multiple notes into a single, coherent performance.

1. Concurrency

The Problem:
Agents must be capable of thinking and acting concurrently. Slow processes (e.g., self-reflection or planning) should not block immediate responses to environmental changes.

Current Limitations:
	•	Single-Threaded Design: Most LLM-based agents use sequential workflows, assuming that tasks occur one at a time and on similar timescales.
	•	Framework Constraints: Popular frameworks (e.g., DSPy, LangChain) are not optimized for concurrent programming.

Our Solution:
	•	Concurrent Modules: Inspired by the brain’s ability to process different functions simultaneously, our architecture runs various modules (e.g., cognition, planning, motor execution, and speech) concurrently.
	•	Stateless Functions & Shared State: Each module operates as a stateless function, reading from and writing to a shared Agent State.
	•	Context-Specific Execution: Modules can be selectively activated (e.g., social modules during interactions) and operate at speeds appropriate to their function (e.g., fast reflexes vs. deliberate planning).

2. Coherence

The Problem:
Running multiple modules in parallel can lead to incoherent outputs (e.g., the agent might say one thing while doing another).

Current Limitations:
	•	Sequential Systems: Coherence is easier to maintain when outputs are generated sequentially.
	•	Multiple Output Modalities: With various independent modules (e.g., arms, legs, facial expressions, speech), maintaining a unified behavior becomes challenging.

Our Solution:
	•	Cognitive Controller (CC): A dedicated module that makes high-level decisions, ensuring that outputs from various modules align.
	•	Information Bottleneck: The CC receives a filtered subset of the Agent State, focusing on relevant information and allowing for explicit control over data flow.
	•	Broadcast Mechanism: Once a high-level decision is made, it is broadcast to all relevant modules, ensuring that actions (especially those related to speech) are coherent with the overall decision-making process.
	•	Neuroscientific Inspiration: This design mirrors theories of human consciousness where a centralized decision-maker coordinates various outputs.

Core Modules

Our system consists of 10 concurrent modules. Key modules include:
	•	Memory: Stores and retrieves interactions, actions, and observations across various timescales.
	•	Action Awareness: Monitors the agent’s state and performance for real-time adjustments.
	•	Goal Generation: Develops new objectives based on the agent’s experiences and environmental feedback.
	•	Social Awareness: Interprets and responds to social cues to support cooperation and communication.
	•	Talking: Manages both speech interpretation and generation.
	•	Skill Execution: Performs specific actions within the environment.

By integrating these modules into a concurrent and bottlenecked architecture, our agents achieve continuous, coherent behavior, balancing fast responses with deliberate planning.
