File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded

bots should probably have some modules enabled/disabled based on role. For example a hunter might not need to decide whether he wants to farm or not every tick.

cognitive controller? 

draft of cc:

    each tick:
        fire observation to get surroundings
        if humans present:
            use social
        if mobs present:
            danger module?
        query goals/action awareness? (each tick bot should be like hmm what am i doing right now.)

 
        what am i doing right now:
            check short term goals

    should have ability to lock in and stop doing api calls while fulfilling basic tasks i.e. mining or fighting
        
    Lets say goal is to craft an iron pickaxe.

        what am i doing right now:
            check short term goals.
            check short term memory for evidence of work towards goal.
            try to measure completion of goal. 
            try to measure what is necessary to complete goal (memory does not include having built an iron pickaxe) (check inventory). 
            Say we have no iron pickaxe, only a wood one.
            Break down into subgoals is a good idea. So goal(get iron pickaxe) = (mine iron ore, make furnace, smelt iron ore, craft iron pickaxe). 
            Perhaps subgoals can be broken down into subsubgoals. 
            So goal(get iron pickaxe) = (mine iron ore(find iron ore, go to iron ore, mine iron ore(3)), make furnace(ensure enough stone else mine stone, craft furnace ), smelt iron ore(put ore in furnace, wood in furnace), craft iron pickaxe(get sticks, craft pickaxe)).

PIANO Architecture: A Brain-Inspired Approach to Humanlike AI

We introduce PIANO (Parallel Input Aggregation via Neural Orchestration), an architecture inspired by the brain. It leverages two key design principlesâ€”concurrency and an information bottleneckâ€”to enable AI agents to interact with their environment in real time, much like a pianist orchestrates multiple notes into a single, coherent performance.

1. Concurrency

The Problem:
Agents must be capable of thinking and acting concurrently. Slow processes (e.g., self-reflection or planning) should not block immediate responses to environmental changes.

Current Limitations:
	â€¢	Single-Threaded Design: Most LLM-based agents use sequential workflows, assuming that tasks occur one at a time and on similar timescales.
	â€¢	Framework Constraints: Popular frameworks (e.g., DSPy, LangChain) are not optimized for concurrent programming.

Our Solution:
	â€¢	Concurrent Modules: Inspired by the brainâ€™s ability to process different functions simultaneously, our architecture runs various modules (e.g., cognition, planning, motor execution, and speech) concurrently.
	â€¢	Stateless Functions & Shared State: Each module operates as a stateless function, reading from and writing to a shared Agent State.
	â€¢	Context-Specific Execution: Modules can be selectively activated (e.g., social modules during interactions) and operate at speeds appropriate to their function (e.g., fast reflexes vs. deliberate planning).

2. Coherence

The Problem:
Running multiple modules in parallel can lead to incoherent outputs (e.g., the agent might say one thing while doing another).

Current Limitations:
	â€¢	Sequential Systems: Coherence is easier to maintain when outputs are generated sequentially.
	â€¢	Multiple Output Modalities: With various independent modules (e.g., arms, legs, facial expressions, speech), maintaining a unified behavior becomes challenging.

Our Solution:
	â€¢	Cognitive Controller (CC): A dedicated module that makes high-level decisions, ensuring that outputs from various modules align.
	â€¢	Information Bottleneck: The CC receives a filtered subset of the Agent State, focusing on relevant information and allowing for explicit control over data flow.
	â€¢	Broadcast Mechanism: Once a high-level decision is made, it is broadcast to all relevant modules, ensuring that actions (especially those related to speech) are coherent with the overall decision-making process.
	â€¢	Neuroscientific Inspiration: This design mirrors theories of human consciousness where a centralized decision-maker coordinates various outputs.

Core Modules

Our system consists of 10 concurrent modules. Key modules include:
	â€¢	Memory: Stores and retrieves interactions, actions, and observations across various timescales.
	â€¢	Action Awareness: Monitors the agentâ€™s state and performance for real-time adjustments.
	â€¢	Goal Generation: Develops new objectives based on the agentâ€™s experiences and environmental feedback.
	â€¢	Social Awareness: Interprets and responds to social cues to support cooperation and communication.
	â€¢	Talking: Manages both speech interpretation and generation.
	â€¢	Skill Execution: Performs specific actions within the environment.

By integrating these modules into a concurrent and bottlenecked architecture, our agents achieve continuous, coherent behavior, balancing fast responses with deliberate planning.
