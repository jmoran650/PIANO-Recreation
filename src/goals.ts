 * Manages the bot's goals. A "long-term goal" is the primary objective
 * (e.g., "get iron pickaxe"). It is composed of multiple "short-term goals"
 * (subtasks) that can be executed sequentially or in parallel.
 *
 * This class:
 * - Maintains one current long-term goal at a time.
 * - Maintains one current short-term goal from among that long-term goal's subtasks.
 * - Allows insertion of new long-term goals (the bot might queue them up or switch).
 * - Breaks down a long-term goal into subtasks using an LLM (stubbed).
